OUScope
================

<!-- WARNING: THIS FILE WAS AUTOGENERATED! DO NOT EDIT! -->

The library provides access and control for the telescope. The functions
help with job submission, image retrival and initial analysis. For naw
this is aimed at variable star observations, but there is nothing
prohibiting additional modules intended for different fields
(e.g.Â astrometry).

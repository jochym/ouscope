# OUScope

> The `ouscope` is a library providing python interface to the Open
> University Autonomous Robotic Telescope facility at telescope.org

The library provides access and control for the telescope. The functions
help with job submission, image retrival and initial analysis. For naw
this is aimed at variable star observations, but there is nothing
prohibiting additional modules intended for different fields
(e.g. astrometry).
